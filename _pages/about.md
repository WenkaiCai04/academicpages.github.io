Background
=====
I'm a forth year undergraduate student from [School of Applied Physics](https://physics.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) in [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/)  

My research interest includes **ferroelectric and spinchonics device, semiconductor oxides，adcanced material growth: epitaxy(PLD ALD) or ceramic sintering(SPS)**

Ferroelectric film for storage and computaion (experiment)

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jingsheng Chen]([https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=MRcUU1gAAAAJ&hl=en](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/mse/staff/chen-jingsheng/)), National University of Singapore. 
Here, I participate in a project to realize a 2D ferroelectric triode, which could be stacked on the Z-axis to continue the Moor's Law.

Domain wall is a quasi-two dimesional structure, in which we could see dozens of new phenomena, like giant conductivity compared with domain region and topology protection
As Herbert Kroemer's famous saying goes, **"Interface is physics."** I'm trying to figure out the pattern behind such **conductive property in domain wall.**  

Futhermore, as domain wall could be manipulate by field, it could be erase and write. Excitedly, I am finding the way to use a single domain wall as an electronic device.
 

Relaxor ferroelectric ceramics for energy storage (experiment and computation)

There are many high-power miniaturized capacitors in electronic devices. These inorganic capacitors have high charge and discharge power, but the total energy storage density needs to be improved.

We need to use dielectric materials with large polarization strength and breakdown resistance to prepare capacitors. **Relaxor ferroelectrics** are very suitable materials. Not only do they have large polarization strength, but they also have small energy loss.
