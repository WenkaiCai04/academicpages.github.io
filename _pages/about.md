Background
=====
I'm a forth year undergraduate student from [School of Applied Physics](https://physics.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) in [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/)  

My research interest includes **ferroelectric and spinchonics device, semiconductor oxides，adcanced material growth: epitaxy(PLD ALD) or ceramic sintering(SPS)**

Ferroelectric film for storage and computaion (experiment)

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jingsheng Chen]([https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=MRcUU1gAAAAJ&hl=en](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/mse/staff/chen-jingsheng/)), National University of Singapore. 
Here, I participate in a project to realize a 2D ferroelectric triode, which could be stacked on the Z-axis to continue the Moor's Law.
