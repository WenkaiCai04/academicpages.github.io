Background
=====
I'm a forth year undergraduate student from [School of Applied Physics](https://physics.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) in [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/)  

My research interest includes **ferroelectric and spinchonics device, semiconductor oxides，adcanced material growth: epitaxy(PLD ALD) or ceramic sintering(SPS)**

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jingsheng Chen]([https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=MRcUU1gAAAAJ&hl=en](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/mse/staff/chen-jingsheng/)), National University of Singapore. 
Here, I participate in a project to realize a 2D ferroelectric triode, which could be stacked on the Z-axis to continue the Moor's Law.

Domain wall is a quasi-two dimesional structure, in which we could see dozens of new phenomena, like giant conductivity compared with domain region and topology protection
As Herbert Kroemer's famous saying goes, **"Interface is physics."** I'm trying to figure out the pattern behind such **conductive property in domain wall.**  

Futhermore, as domain wall could be manipulate by field, it could be erase and write. Excitedly, I am finding the way to use a single domain wall as an electronic device.
